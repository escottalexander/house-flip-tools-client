### Technology used

The House Flip Tools was built using React, React Router, Redux, Redux Form and Enzyme for testing. The back-end utilized Node with Express, Morgan for logging, Sequelize for interfacing with the PostgreSQl database, Passport with bcryptjs for all authentication, and Mocha with Chai for the testing suite.

I had a blast building this project. I especially loved learning how to incorporate Redux into the react ecosystem as it was my first time doing so. It was lots of fun to build.
